<h2>My introduction to the Dead and San Francisco Experience</h2>

        <p>I was introduced to the Grateful dead when I was in high school. I remember listing to Dick's Picks Volume 1. in my first car on the way to school. 
        I was blown away by their jams and how every show was a different musical experience
        </p>

    </p>I moved to San Francisco for work in 2012 where I spent the next 4 years. I became even more interested in the Dead since I was now living in the epicenter of what was the countercultral revolution of 1960s America where so many great musical talents made their name on the Bay Area music scene. I took advantage of my time there by going to as many shows as I could, including getting to see Phil Lesh (Bassist) at his restuarant/concert hall and even getting to a New Year's Eve Dead & Company Show at the Forum in Los Angeles on 12/31/15
